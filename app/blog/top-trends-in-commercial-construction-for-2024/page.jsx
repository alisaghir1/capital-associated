          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">1. Sustainable Construction Practices</h2>
          <p className="text-black">Sustainability continues to be a major focus. The increasing emphasis on eco-friendly materials, energy-efficient designs, and green building certifications is evident. Net-zero energy buildings are becoming more common, along with improved waste management and the integration of renewable energy sources. Cement production, responsible for 8% of global CO2 emissions, is a target for innovation with materials like biocement and self-replicating concrete that absorb CO2 during production.</p>
          <p className="text-black mt-2">For instance, BioMason, a company pioneering in biocement, has raised over $95 million in venture funding to develop cement that absorbs CO2, showcasing the industry's commitment to reducing its carbon footprint.</p>

        <section>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">2. Modular and Prefabricated Construction</h2>
          <p className="text-black">Modular and prefabricated construction methods are gaining traction due to their efficiency and cost-effectiveness. These methods reduce waste, enhance quality control, and speed up project completion. According to the Modular Building Institute, modular construction can reduce build times by up to 50% and costs by 20%. This trend addresses the demand for rapid construction solutions and is being adopted in various projects, from residential complexes to large commercial buildings.</p>
