        {/* Tips */}
        <section>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">1. Define Your Goals and Priorities</h3>
          <p className="text-black mb-4">
            Before swinging a hammer, clearly define your goals. Are you renovating to increase your home’s value, improve functionality, or enhance aesthetic appeal? Understanding your primary objectives will guide your decisions throughout the project.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">2. Set a Realistic Budget</h3>
          <p className="text-black mb-4">
            An essential step in home renovation is setting a budget. Factor in materials, labor, permits, and a contingency fund for unexpected expenses. Research average costs for similar projects and consult professionals to get realistic estimates.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">3. Choose the Right Contractor</h3>
          <p className="text-black mb-4">
            Selecting the right contractor can make or break your renovation. Look for licensed, insured, and experienced professionals with positive reviews. Get multiple quotes and check references before making a decision.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">4. Obtain Necessary Permits</h3>
          <p className="text-black mb-4">
            Depending on the scope of your project, you may need permits. Failure to obtain the necessary permits can result in fines and complications. Research local building codes and regulations or consult your contractor for guidance.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">5. Plan for Efficiency and Sustainability</h3>
          <p className="text-black mb-4">
            Incorporate energy efficiency into your plans. Consider materials and appliances that reduce energy consumption and lower utility bills.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">6. Design for the Future</h3>
          <p className="text-black mb-4">
            Consider long-term needs and trends. A design that accommodates future lifestyle changes can be a wise investment. This might include flexible spaces or smart home technologies.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">7. Pay Attention to Details</h3>
          <p className="text-black mb-4">
            Details can make a significant difference. From the style of door handles to the color of the paint, these elements contribute to the overall look and feel of your renovation.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">8. Communicate Effectively</h3>
          <p className="text-black mb-4">
            Maintain open lines of communication with your contractor and design team. Regular check-ins can help catch issues early and keep the project on track.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">9. Prepare for Disruption</h3>
          <p className="text-black mb-4">
            Renovations can be disruptive to your daily life. Prepare for noise, dust, and potential changes in your routine. Set up a temporary kitchen or living space if necessary.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">10. Stay Flexible and Patient</h3>
          <p className="text-black mb-4">
            Finally, be prepared for delays and challenges. Flexibility and patience are crucial in managing the unexpected hiccups that often accompany renovation projects.
