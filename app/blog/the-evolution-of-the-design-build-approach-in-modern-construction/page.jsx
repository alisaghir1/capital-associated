          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Historical Background</h2>
          <div className="w-full mt-4 mb-6">
            <Image src="/blogs/The-Evolution-of-the-Design-Build-Approach-in-Modern-Construction/2.jpg" alt="Historical background" width={1000} height={562} className="w-full h-auto rounded-lg object-contain" />
          </div>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Ancient Practices</h3>
          <p className="text-black">The design-build concept is not new; it has roots in ancient construction practices. Civilizations such as the Egyptians and Greeks employed a unified approach to construction. A single master builder, often a craftsman with comprehensive skills, was responsible for both designing and constructing monumental structures. This method ensured that the vision and execution were seamlessly aligned.</p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">The Medieval Era</h3>
          <p className="text-black">During the medieval period, the construction of cathedrals and castles in Europe continued to reflect a design-build approach. Master builders, who were highly skilled artisans, oversaw the entire construction process. These individuals possessed deep knowledge of both architectural principles and building techniques, allowing them to guide projects from concept to completion.</p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">The Renaissance and Enlightenment</h3>
          <p className="text-black">The Renaissance brought a shift towards specialization in the construction industry. As architectural knowledge expanded and became more complex, the roles of architects and builders began to separate. Architects focused on designing aesthetically pleasing structures, while builders concentrated on the practical aspects of construction. This division marked the beginning of the design-bid-build model.</p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Traditional Methods</h2>
          <div className="w-full mt-4 mb-6">
            <Image src="/blogs/The-Evolution-of-the-Design-Build-Approach-in-Modern-Construction/3.jpg" alt="Traditional methods" width={1000} height={562} className="w-full h-auto rounded-lg object-contain" />
          </div>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Design-Bid-Build Model</h3>
          <p className="text-black">The design-bid-build model became the standard construction method by the 19th century. This approach involved three distinct phases:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-5 text-black">
            <li>Design Phase: Architects and engineers created detailed plans and specifications for the project.</li>
            <li>Bidding Phase: Contractors reviewed the plans and submitted bids to undertake the construction work.</li>
            <li>Construction Phase: The selected contractor executed the project based on the architectural plans.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Challenges of the Design-Bid-Build Model</h3>
          <p className="text-black">The design-bid-build model faced several challenges: communication gaps, extended timelines, and cost overruns caused by revisiting the design phase when issues emerged during construction.</p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Emergence of the Design-Build Model</h2>
          <div className="w-full mt-4 mb-6">
            <Image src="/blogs/The-Evolution-of-the-Design-Build-Approach-in-Modern-Construction/4.jpg" alt="Emergence of design-build" width={1000} height={562} className="w-full h-auto rounded-lg object-contain" />
          </div>
          <p className="text-black">The design-build model began to gain traction in the early 20th century as a response to the limitations of the design-bid-build approach. This method integrates design and construction, allowing for a more collaborative and efficient process. Early adopters of the design-build model recognized its potential to streamline project delivery and improve communication.</p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Modern Integration</h3>
          <p className="text-black">In recent decades, the design-build model has become increasingly popular across various sectors. Clients and contractors alike have recognized its numerous benefits, leading to its widespread adoption. The design-build approach offers a single point of responsibility, reducing the potential for conflicts and streamlining decision-making processes.</p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Technological Impact</h2>
          <div className="w-full mt-4 mb-6">
            <Image src="/blogs/The-Evolution-of-the-Design-Build-Approach-in-Modern-Construction/5.jpg" alt="Technological impact" width={1000} height={562} className="w-full h-auto rounded-lg object-contain" />
          </div>
          <p className="text-black">One of the most significant technological advancements that have influenced the design-build approach is Building Information Modeling (BIM). BIM involves creating digital representations of physical and functional characteristics of buildings. This technology enhances collaboration by providing a shared platform where architects, engineers, and contractors can work together seamlessly.</p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Virtual Reality (VR)</h3>
          <p className="text-black">Virtual Reality (VR) has also made significant contributions to the design-build approach. VR technology allows clients and project teams to experience a virtual walkthrough of the project before construction begins.</p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Project Management Software</h3>
          <p className="text-black">Advanced project management software has revolutionized the design-build process. These tools facilitate efficient project planning, scheduling, and execution.</p>
